        <h1>My Sincere Apology</h1>
        <p>A letter from my heart to yours</p>
    </div>

    <div class="letter-body">
        <p>Dear Love,</p>

        <p>
            I sit here today with a heart full of remorse, struggling to find the right words to express 
            how truly sorry I am for the pain I've caused you. No amount of words can undo the hurt, 
            but I want you to know that I understand the weight of my actions.
        </p>

        <p>
            You trusted me, believed in me, and loved me with a purity that I failed to honor. I took 
            that trust for granted, and for that, I am deeply sorry. Every moment since has been filled 
            with the realization of how much I've let you down.
        </p>

        <p>
            I never intended to hurt you. You mean everything to me, and my actions contradicted what 
            my heart truly feels. That contradiction haunts me, and I am committed to being better, to 
            being worthy of the love you've shown me.
        </p>

        <p>
            I understand if forgiveness doesn't come easily. I'm prepared to spend whatever time it takes 
            to rebuild the trust I've broken and to show you through my actions, not just my words, that 
            I am genuinely sorry and will do everything in my power to make things right.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for reading this. I hope that someday, when you're ready, you might find it in your 
            heart to forgive me.
        </p>

        <p>Forever yours,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="letter-signature">
        <p>With deepest sincerity,</p>
        <p><strong>Your Love</strong></p>
